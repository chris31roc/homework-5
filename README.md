## Description
 
Work Day Calendar is a simple application that allows the user to plan their work day according to what is set at for them at certain times of the the day for a full seven days. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and when the user scrolls down, time slots for standard business hours are presented. This is where an event like a meeting or conference call can be entered. The user can click the save button for that time slot and the event will be saved in local storage. Work Day Calendar runs in the browser and features updated HTML and CSS, all powered by jQuery.
